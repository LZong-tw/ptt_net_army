This is a backup from the repository of a suspected "Cyber warrior", who is a supporter or a hired worker of Ko, Wen-je, Taipei mayor, at the time it was found. According to the descriptions of the types(e.g. "智障", idiot in Mandarin) on the list, we can doubt that it was built to lead the public opinion to "hate", "criticize" the IDs(some of which were found that they are actually real people) on the list, by adding them as a default blacklist of a telnet explorer, PTT Star, which was created to explore PTT, the largest Internet community of Taiwan, due to the historical reason, it's a BBS, so it needed a telnet explorer to make the exploring experience better.
